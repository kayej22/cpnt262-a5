## General Notes
  Assignment was refactured from the previous assignment. I went through and modified and cleaned up a great deal of this project.
  
  This assingment was pretty mind breaking for me at points. Vitaly helped out a great deal by giving me a one on one tutorial session to help guide me through the parts I was shaky on.

  Aidan was also super helpful with advising on the single image route.
